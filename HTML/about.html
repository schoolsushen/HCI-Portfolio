            My name is Sushen Kolakaleti, I am a Computer Science Student at Virginia Tech, graduating in 2024.
            I am an avid chess player and I have played chess at a high level in US. I am also a cricket lover
            and I have played cricket for the USA U-16 team. I love software engineering and robotics as well, and
            I was a part of FIRST robotics for 8 years. My tenure in FIRST robotics led to many state championships and even
            a top-20 performance at the U-16 World Championships. I am also in Rocketry at VT working on the usage of computer 
            vision for recovery systems. I am especially interested in the combination of computer vision, AI, and how humans 
            interact with these systems. <br /> <br />
            I also started a freelance company called Yamuna Software Solutions, which is dedicated to open-source software 
            ideology and freelance work. The ultimate goal is to make expensive proprietary software more accessible and free. 
            Using this ideology, we have developed several apps, frameworks, games, and technologies to make software and 
            engineering tools more straightforward to use and access. We also offer several freelance services to companies 
            including web development, Java database development, Android development help, and more.
